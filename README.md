# mooglepy

I’m pulling character genders and looking at them across the iterations of the Final Fantasy games to see what that ratio looks like and if it’s growing in one direction, the other, or balancing out. 

### Instructions

Modules you'll need:
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* requests
* sqlite3

So make sure you have those things ready to go.
Then just simply clone, open a command prompt or terminal, and navigate to the directory you just cloned.
Run mooglepy.py from the terminal.

(Your actual syntax may vary depending on how things are setup. For example, I run python mooglepy.py on my Mac and just mooglepy.py on my Windows.)
