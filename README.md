# mooglepy

### Instructions

Modules you'll need:
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* requests
* sqlite3

So make sure you have those things ready to go.
Then just simply clone, open a command prompt or terminal, and navigate to the directory you just cloned.
Run mooglepy.py from the terminal.

(Your actual syntax may vary depending on how things are setup. For example, I run python mooglepy.py on my Mac and just mooglepy.py on my Windows.)
